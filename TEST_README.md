 ALL THE MENTIONED REFERENCES ARE NECESSARY TO BE UNDERSTOOD IN TESTING THE GAME I HAVE CREATED. THEY HELPED ME TO DO TEST CASES. unittest was especially chosen since it is better than pytest.

TESTCASES were done on the following attributes

snake_positions: this will represent the head position of the snake.
snake_body: A list of lists representing the body segments of the snake.
score: An integer giving the player's score. 
game_over: A boolean will tell if the game is over or not.
Methods:

move_up, move_down, move_left, move_right: show the snake's position.

collision_with_wall: Check if the game ends when snake collides with the game boundaries. 

collision_with_self: Check if the game ends when it hit its own body


run_game: Placeholder for the game loop.

game_over_display: Display the game over message with the player's score.
TestGame Class:
Class Methods:

setUpClass: Initialize Pygame when the test class is set up.
tearDownClass: Quit Pygame when the test class is torn down.
Instance Methods:

setUp: Redirect stdout to a StringIO object before each test.

tearDown: Restore the original stdout after each test.


test_move_up, test_move_down, test_move_left, test_move_right: Testing the snake movement methods up down left and right.

test_collision_with_wall: Testing collision detection with game boundaries.

test_collision_with_self: Testing collision detection with the snake's body.
test_fruit_collision: Testing collision with fruit
test_game_over_display: Testing the display of the game over message.
Main Block:
Run the unit tests when the script is executed.
